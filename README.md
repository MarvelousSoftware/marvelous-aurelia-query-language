# Getting started
The `marvelous-aurelia-query-language` is an open source domain specific language built on top of <code>.NET</code> platform. 
The goal is to provide advanced users a way to quickly get needed data. It has built-in support for auto completions. 

Although the code editor is using aurelia framework the further version will provide a separate, independent package.

Project documentation: [http://marvelous.software/docs.html#/query-language](http://marvelous.software/docs.html#/query-language)

.NET backend source code: https://github.com/MarvelousSoftware/MarvelousSoftwareDotNet

NOTE: Please bear in mind that this library is still in the early beta and some features might be missing.

## Installation
The `marvelous-aurelia-query-language` consists of 2 packages: client side and server side. First install client side library:
```
jspm install marvelous-aurelia-query-language
```
Then load the css file and let know aurelia about the query language plugin:
```javascript
import 'marvelous-aurelia-query-language/styles/default.css!';
// ...

export function configure(aurelia) {  
  let config = aurelia.use;
  
  config
    // ...
    .plugin('marvelous-aurelia-query-language');
  
  aurelia.start().then(a => {
    a.setRoot();
  });
}
```
To install server side part of the library use following NuGet install command:
```
Install-Package MarvelousSoftware.QueryLanguage
```
Once you do that install either `MarvelousSoftware.Core.Host.Owin` or `MarvelousSoftware.Core.Host.SystemWeb` NuGet package and use 
it on the application start up:
```csharp
using System.Web;
using MarvelousSoftware.Core.Host.SystemWeb;

namespace MarvelousSoftware.Examples.API
{
    public class WebApiApplication : HttpApplication
    {
        protected void Application_Start()
        {
            // This line allows to use MarvelousSoftware products with SystemWeb
            // It comes from MarvelousSoftware.Core.Host.SystemWeb package
            MarvelousSoftwareHost.UseSystemWeb();
            
            // If you would like to use MarvelousSoftware products with more modern, Owin based applications
            // then use MarvelousSoftware.Core.Host.Owin package and place below line in Startup.cs file 
            // app.UseMarvelousSoftware();
            
            //.. rest of app's startup configuration
        }
    }
}
```
Now you are ready to go.

## Building The Code
This repository depends on other marvelous software repositories. In order to provide seamless development flow these libraries are watched automatically. The only prerequisite is following directories structure:

-- MarvelousSoftware

--- marvelous-aurelia-query-language

--- marvelous-aurelia-core

Once the structure is correct `gulp watch` command will listen to dependend libraries changes.
